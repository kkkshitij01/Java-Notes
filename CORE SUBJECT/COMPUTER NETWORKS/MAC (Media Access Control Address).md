## 1. Definition and Naming

The **MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)** is a physical address used to uniquely identify a device's **Network Interface Card (NIC)** within a network segment.

- **Layer of Operation:** The MAC address operates at **Layer 2 (the Data Link Layer)** of the OSI Model.
    
- **Immutability:** It is often referred to as a **burned-in address (BIA)** because it is permanently stored in the hardware's Read-Only Memory (ROM) by the manufacturer.
    
- **Scope:** It is used **only** for local communication within a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.
    

## 2. Format and Structure

A MAC address is a **48-bit address**, typically represented by **12 hexadecimal digits** (6 bytes).

- **Presentation:** It is written in six pairs separated by hyphens or colons.
